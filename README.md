This HOWTO is about modifying GNUTLS to make OpenConnect work with
LuxTrust/Gemalto smartcards on GNU/Linux. It shows you how to patch the 
GNUTLS library, build and install the new package and how to invoke OpenConnect
to make a successful connection to a remote VPN gateway.

The fix is simple, ugly but
functionnal, and will probably break some other applications.
